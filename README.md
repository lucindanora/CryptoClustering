Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
    What is the total explained variance of the three principal components? 89.5%

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
    Answer the following question in your notebook:

    What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? 4
    Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data? NO


Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

    What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

    Using fewer features (PCA data) to cluster the data using K-means results in tighter,
    more obvious clusters and has reduced the impact of noise.  This highlights the visible
    patterns and separations making the reuslts more useful.
